Difference between Linux and Windows versions
---------------------------------------------

They are mainly the same. Difference comes from:

1. The path of hosts file and file system information is different.
2. Online application and games depend on platform, so the black list is different.
3. Runnable scripts and the method to get root/admin permission are different.
